# basic-text-adventure-game
A basic text-based adventure I created with a class-mate as a major assignment in my first year at university.

This project was last editted on the 21st of October, 2016.

I worked on this with a fellow programmer, Jarrod Salmon. We shared the work load evenly with each person working on a select
group of classes.
I unfortunatley can't remember exactly which classes I specificly worked on as at the moment of uploading this it has been 
almost a year since looking at the code.
However I do recall spending a great deal of time on the main file and writting a lot of the comments throughout the
numerous .cpp and .h files.
